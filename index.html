        <h1>HISTORY OF THIS PLACE</h1>
        <p>
          The Sadashiva temple has a mythological story associated with it. It
          is believed that the top portion of the famed 'atma-linga' fell here.
          In Hindu mythology, the story goes that the 'atma-linga' had the power
          to make the Gods immortal. This atma-linga was in the custody of Lord
          Shiva. Ravana, the asura king, and the reigning king of Lanka desired
          to attain immortality. To fulfill this desire, he conducted strong
          penance to Lord Shiva and was successful in pleasing the Lord. Having
          been pleased by Ravana, Lord Shiva offered him a boon. Ravana asked
          for the Atma-linga and Shiva relented on the condition that it should
          not be put down on the ground or anywhere else till the time he
          reached Lanka. Narada judged the ominous situation of Ravana getting
          immortal. He sought the help of Lord Ganesha in this matter. With the
          help of Lord Vishnu's illusion, Ganesha, in the disguise of a Brahmin
          boy appeared before Ravana at the time of him needing to take a bath.
          Ravana took a long time to return from his bath and the Brahmin boy
          (Ganesha) got impatient. He left the linga on the ground and left -
          the place is now called Gokarna. On seeing the atma-linga on the
          ground, the furious Ravana tried to uproot it from the ground. On
          striking the linga, parts of it broke and the top-most part is said to
          have fallen at Surathkal where the Sadashiva temple is located.
          Sadashiva temple has been built around the headstone, while the famous
          Murudeshwara temple was built where the second piece fell.
          Incidentally this is also how Surathkal got its name - 'Shiradakal' in
          Kannada means headstone.
